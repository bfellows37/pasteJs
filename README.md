threaded discussion board

This is an exercise in getting to know Angular 4. The board is a "threaded" discussion platform using a materialized path tree structure.

Uses Mongo as the data store and NodeJS to run the backend API.

## how to run a quick demo

Have docker and docker-compose installed.

The docker-compose.yml file is set up to download built images from dockerhub.

1. Clone the repo, and navigate into the directory
2. run `docker-compose up`

You should be able to access the app at http://localhost:80
